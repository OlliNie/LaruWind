# LaruWind

## OBJECTIVE:
Increase the wind forcast accuracy at the Lauttasaari kite spot (Kasinoranta and Kaislikko).  This will require
- Back-end to analyze wind forcast and to improve it
- Front-end to be able to fetch wind forcast data from the back-end using an API and to present the data

## OBSERVATIONS:
- It seems that the wind forcast at Harmaja is typically stronger than at the kite spot
- Even when it is windy at Harmaja for some reason the wind does not get all the way to the kite spot
- The wind seems to die off at the kite spot before the forcasted time especially in the spring
- Sometimes the windforcast is completely wrong

## TODO: FRONT-END

## TODO: BACK-END
- Identify key features that effect wind at the local kite spot
- Implement machine learning to come up with a way of improving wind forcast
- Provide an API capable to providing improved forecast to the front-end
